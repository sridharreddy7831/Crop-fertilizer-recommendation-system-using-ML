# week1  Crop &amp; Fertilizer Recommendation System Using ML

# Crop Recommendation System

## Overview
This project involves analyzing agricultural data to develop a crop recommendation system. Using various machine learning and data analysis techniques, the system aims to recommend the most suitable crops based on specific environmental and soil parameters. The dataset used is `Crop_recommendation.csv`.

## Features
- Data analysis and visualization using Python libraries.
- Insights into the dataset, such as crop suitability based on environmental conditions.
- Recommendations for optimal crop growth.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models (if applicable).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-link.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd crop-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset `Crop_recommendation.csv` includes information on various factors influencing crop growth, such as:
- Soil pH
- Rainfall
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Nutrient levels

## Usage
1. Load the dataset:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   crop = pd.read_csv("Dataset/Crop_recommendation.csv")
   ```
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset:
   ```python
   crop.head()  # View the first 5 rows
   crop.shape   # Get dataset dimensions
   ```
3. Use visualization tools like seaborn and matplotlib to uncover patterns and trends.
4. Implement machine learning models (if included) to predict suitable crops based on input parameters.

## Example Output
- Recommendations for the most suitable crop based on user input.
- Visualizations highlighting correlations and trends.
